# Keras Colour Converter
A machine learning model that can learn to convert colours 
from the RGB space to L\*a\*b\* using 

This project was inspired by [jeyj0/PyNNet](https://github.com/jeyj0/PyNNet).

I do realize this may not be a very interesting application for machine learning
but it seemed appropriate to get familiar with Keras and only took the better
part of a night to build.

## Running
1. Run `generate_dataset.py` to generate a training and validation set.
2. Run `colour_converter.py` to train and test the model.
